## What is this site ???

Well, get comfy. Let me tell you the story ... It all began a couple weeks ago. I wanted a place to showcase my art in a more interactive way than a plain ole gallery (although, this site has that too). I also wanted to brush up on my React skills. So, I thought: *Why not kill two birds with one stone and build that **place** using **React***? You can probably deduce what happened next

...

I built it. That place. It's this site!

 ... 
 
Just to be clear: I didn't kill *any* birds. Not a single one. Zero. No birds were harmed in the making of this website. I promise!

Ok, storytime's over. You can get uncomfy now, if you want. Or maybe you already were ... It was the bird talk, wasn't it? Darnit. I'm sorry. Really, I didn't even *look* at birds while working on this project. Or, at least I think so ... ? I might have glanced at, like ... a pigeon. There are loads of pigeons in town. Hard to avoid, really. And I don't remember all the pigeons I see or don't see. Could have seen a pigeon and forgotten about it. That sorta thing happens more than you th- ... Aw shucks, here I go again. Let's just move on ...

If you're looking for a more technical answer, look right here: This is a static web application, coded & illustrated by me (Sanna (Susanna Berntsson)), with music composed by the brilliant Ossian Borén. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template, and uses [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for routing.
